## Impact analysis
This feature enables the user to measure the direct impact of any strategy/campaign by simply comparing the metrics before and after the event. The data visualized is the percentage change between two time periods. The change can be measured across hours, days, weeks, or months. You can pick the time period most relevant to your use case and the metric you want to analyze. 

_For example: How did this incentive campaign impact my key metrics? Which areas have been growing week on week?_
