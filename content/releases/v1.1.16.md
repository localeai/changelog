## Impact analysis

This feature enables the user to measure the direct impact of any strategy/campaign by simply comparing the metrics before and after the event. The data visualized is the percentage change between two time periods. The change can be measured across hours, days, weeks, or months. You can pick the time period most relevant to your use case and the metric you want to analyze.

> For example: How did this incentive campaign impact my key metrics? Which areas have been growing week on week?

## Collaboration

This feature is designed to promote communication and collaboration across various teams (data scientists, analysts, product teams, and operations teams) for debugging and brainstorming. Once you tag a team member in a problematic area with a comment, they get an email notification. Upon getting the notification, they can resolve, reply and delete which enables them to adapt to the real-time situations (just like Slack threads). It is designed to become a knowledge base of your insights and encourage problem solving, keeping in mind the right context and being transparent makes for a great collaborative environment.

> For example: @alex, why are cancellations so high in the eastern part of the city?

## Polygons

The polygon feature allows the user to analyze the performance of their zones or operational boundaries. You can simply upload these zones unique to your company by uploading their boundary definition of districts, counties, towns. You can drill down granularly into these zones and compare their performance with each other.

> For example: What are the cancellations in Winston as compared to Lauderdale?

## Real-time Pipeline

The data will be updated at regular time intervals based on the desired update frequency by the user. It could range from 5-minute intervals to 24-hour intervals.
